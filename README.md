=======

Aims to create a framework for performing 2d battle simulations of team-based autonomous agents coordinated by a controller.

If you'd like to create your own controllers, inherit from controllers.base.Controller, override at least think(), and change main.py to instantiate your custom controller for your given team. More documentation to come.
